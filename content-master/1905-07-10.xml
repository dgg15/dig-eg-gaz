                            insolence, failed completely in his school career, and finally robbed
                            his father of £200, which he spent in riotous living. The remonstrances
                            of the justly indignant sheikh appear to have inspired the boy with the
                            idea of killing his father and sisters, and enjoying the family wealth
                            at his ease. He accordingly mixed powdered datura leaf with their food
                            and when asked to eat with them, refused. Within an hour of the meal,
                            the sheikh and his three daughters showed symptoms of datura poisoning.
                            The principal medical officer of the moudirieh was called in, and
                            recognising the symptoms, asked the son why he would not eat with his

                            poison found in his pockets. The sheikh and his daughters, who are still
                            dangerously ill, have been sent to the hospital at Minieh. The son has

                            at midday. On the other hand, the fact that his condition is no worse

                            Sheikh Ali Youssef’s organ, “Al Moayad,” writes “We give with the
                            deepest regret and most poignant grief the sad news that has reached us
                            of the Grand Mufti’s health. It has proved impossible to convey the
                            patient to Cairo owing to the increasing gravity of his illness. His
                            many friends and relations are making the most anxious enquiries
                            concerning him. We hope heaven will grant him recovery and a long
                            life.”</p>

                        <p>We hear that Mohamed Bey Saleh, President of the Assiout Court of 1st
                            Instance, has submitted a memorial to the Acting Regent, to the Judicial
                            Adviser, and to the President of the Court of Appeal. In the memorial he
                            claims that his judicial dignity has been offended by the language used
                            by Aly Bey Abou el Fatouh, who represented the Procureur-General, and by
                            Morcos Effendi Fehmy, Bedawi Bey Riffahi’s counsel, ooncerning the
                            Assiout Tribunal’s judgment, during the recent trial before the Court of
                            Appeal. The memorial demands that Morcos Effendi Fahmy should be brought
                            before a council of discipline on the ground of the aspersions cast by
                            him on the character of the Assiout Court. Mohamed Bey Saleh is said to
                            have stated that he would far rather resign his position than be exposed
                            to such attacks on his dignity and that of his colleagues, and see the
                            independence of the judges made a mere name.</p>

                        <dateline>Port Said, Sunday.</dateline>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Messageries S.S. “Polynesien” arrived from Aden,
                            at which port she had taken on board 250 of the survivors the Wreck of
                            the “Chadoc,” which was lost! on Cape Guardafui on 26th June. The S.S.
                            “Iraouaddy,” of the same company, has just arrived from the canal,
                            haying on board the remaining 360, all of whom were picked up by the
                            Russian Volunteer cruiser “Rion” (ex “Smolensk”) on the 1st inst, and
                            landed at Aden, at which port the “Rion” was obliged to coal, she having
                            burned all her woodwork and fittings to enable her to reach Aden. </p>
                        <p>In an interview which I had with two of the passengers of the “Chadoc,” I
                            learned that the vessel went ashore at 4 a.m. close under Guardafui on
                            the 26th ulto. and that most of the ship’s boats were broken up.</p>
                        <p>The Somalis, many of whom spoke French, having served in the “Haussas,”
                            took the whole number, including 80 children, off the vessel, only one
                            being lost in the rescue operations. The passengers in many cases were
                            able to save their personal effects, and the steward’s department to
                            disembark a quantity of provisions. The natives built them rude huts of
                            twigs and gorse and treated them all with considerable kindness, which
                            belies the general idea entertained that the men of that coast are utter
                            savages.</p>
                        <p>After four days spent in the village, they were able to attract the
                            attention of the “Rion” by means of a signal staff erected on a
                            sand-hill to the north of the Cape and were all embarked (save one, who
                            was lost two days before) on the Russian vessel, arriving at Aden all
                            well on the morning of the 4th July.</p>
                        <p>By the “Polynesien” there also arrived 190 Russian refugees, who were
                            transferred to the S.S. “Tchihatchoff,” which vessel sailed last night
                            direct for Odessa.</p>
                        <p>M. Coullant, principal agent of the Suez Canal Company, together with a
                            number of other residents, amongst whom was Mme Schmidt, wife of the
                            sub-agent, left for France in the “Polynesien,’ which is due to arrive
                            at Marseilles at daylight on Thursday.</p>

                        <head>A LOCAL SCANDAL.</head>
                        <p>Some two months ago, I noted the destruction of the “Bains Minerve” and
                            the refusal of the authorities to allow a syndicate to build a similar
                            place on account of the reputation which it had gained. Since then, land
                            has been let in large quantities for the erection of bath houses on the
                            beach, and now, instead of the gambling and so on being carried on in
                            one large building, there are at least 20 or 30 in which the wildest of
                            orgies take place nightly. Not content with that, the whole line of
                            beach is now filthy in the extreme and a grave menace to health—and the
                            police do not see that which is plain to every resident.</p>

                            would no doubt have given them the victory.</p>

                        <head>WATER POLO. R. A. M. C. v. ALEX. SWIMMING CLUB.</head>
                        <p>This fixture was brought off on Saturday afternoon at Rs-el-Tin in lovely
                            weather and before a good turn-out of spectators, both on shore and in
                            boats surrounding the enclosure. The R. A. M. C. started the game with
                            the sun in their eyes and after some near passing Ames got through the
                            defence and opened the score by a high-placed goal, the ball just
                            clearing the cross-bar, in favor of his team. Halftime arrived with a
                            score of one goal to the R A M. C.</p>
                        <p>On resuming, the club team carried the ball down field and for a time the
                            game was confined to the homesters’ goal. Some neat and exciting passing
                            now took place and Ecclestone, clearing, put a well-placed goal in, thus
                            bringing the club’s team score to one. Fast play was now witnessed, the
                            R. A. M.C. . trying hard for the conqueror, but time was celled, the
                            score remaining one all.</p>
                        <p>The following were the teams R.A.M.C.: Steele, Cruise, White, Bright,
                            Ames, Benn, Adams being in goal. Alexandria Swimming Club: Wood,
                            Hewgill, Mace, Darton, Ecclestone, and Webb in goal. Referee: Q. M. S.

                        <p>Members are hereby notified that from Saturday next, the weekly meetings
                            will be held at the basin entered by Custom House Gate No. 28, adjacent
