               <head type="sub"> A.C.C. v. 2nd ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGT.</head>
                
                <p>This match, probably the last of the present season, was played on the A.C.C. ground Friday afternoon. The Regimental XI. won the toss and went in first, but started badly, losing two wickets in the first over. Captain Moore and Murphy made a good stand, both hitting very freely and putting on 42 runs for the fourth wicket, but after their dismissal Major Finch was the only batsman to give much trouble.
                </p>
                <p>The A.C.C. on going in made a bad start, losing two wickets for nine runs, but J. G. Maclaren, who completed his 1,000 runs for the season amid considerable applause, helped Stacey to carry. the score to 51 and H. B. Carver and Stacey quickly made matters safe. Both hit very freely, Stacey scoring 14 fours in his 69, while Carver hit two fives and eight boundaries.
                </p>
               <p> The Cricket club was "at home” in honor of the occasion during the match and the pavilion was crowded. Among those present were Mr. M. de C. Findlay, C.M.G., Mr. Rum bold, Mr. Mitchell Innes, Col. McCracken, Capt. Borton, the officers of the 2nd Royal Berks, Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Carver, and the Misses Carver, Mr. and Mrs. Macpherson Grant, Capt. and Mrs. Kelham, Mr. and Mrs. R. Moss, Mrs. Cave, Mrs. Herbert Carver, Mr. and Mrs. Logan, Mr. and Mrs. Briscoe, Mrs. Fraser, Mrs. Stafford Northcote, Mrs. Atkin, and many others whom we hare no space to mention. The two teams were photographed after the match and the photograph should be a very pleasant souvenir of the occasion. We should like to voice the satisfaction of all who were present at the really excellent arrangements made by the captain and committee of the club for the occasion.
