                    <p>The disturbances were renewed in the suburb of Praga at 11 o'clock yesterday
                        evening. The Hussars fired on the crowd, killing four per- sons and wounding
                        many. At 9.45 p.m. a bomb was thrown into a military patrol which was
                        passing through the chief street. The troops fired three volleys. The bomb
                        killed two Cos- sacks and a policeman, and wounded two ladies. Many persons
                        were killed and wounded by the volleys, but the number is unascertain- able
                        as the troops immediately surrounded the whole district. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>The crowds have stoned some patrols. The soldiers fired, killing two persons
                        and wound- ing a boy. Two other persons were killed during a similar
                        encounter with a police patrol. A bomb was thrown on a patrol yesterday
                        evening but without any effect. The patrol fired and killed three persons
                        and wounded two. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>During the fighting yesterday the troops not only fired but used the butts of
                        their rifles, bayonets, and swords, breaking the heads and limbs of women
                        and children, and inflicting serious injuries. 10 wounded died at the
                        hospital. The death-roll is at least 50.</p>
                    <p>Outwardly all is quiet to-day, but workmen are going from factory to factory
                        to compel the men to strike.</p>
                    <p>The troops at Kalismi, in Poland, entered a church when the congregation was
                        singing patriotic songs. A fight ensued. A soldier and some women were
                        killed.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of yesterday’s bloodshed a general strike has been proclaimed

                        was steaming at a rate of 26 knots when she struck the rock. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>Alhambra Theatre.—The début of the Magnani operetta company took place last
                        night at this theatre before a large and repre- sentative audience. The
                        operetta given was Joseph Strauss's “Fruhlingsluft," which was billed as
                        "Primavera Scapigliata." This lively operetta has been a great success in
                        Europe, and the performance last night did full justice to the brightness of
                        the dialogue and the vivacity of the music. The costumes were very
                        elaborate, and as the period was that of the Directory there was plenty of
                        scope for display. Where all were excellent it is invi- dious to single out
                        any artiste for special praise, but we must make an exception for Signa
                        Imbimbo, whose lively representation of a soubrette created great
                        enthusiasm. Owing to pressure on our space we must hold over a detailed
                        criticism until to-morrow.</p>

                    <p>The manager of this company deserves our congratulations on two things;
                        firstly, on con- ceiving the idea of giving an extra performance in aid of
                        the Jewish schools, and secondly, on chosing for such an occasion the
                        “Toreador.” The latter is probably the best play that has appeared at the
                        Gaiety in recent years: com- posed in a cheery strain the music is more
                        tuneful and original than usual, the libretto clever and witty, and during
                        Act I. the plot is quite interesting and easy to follow. The second act, it
                        is true, has suffered from changes, not all for the best, but it plays
                        brightly and seldom allows the attention of the spectator to leave the
                        stage. Of the eight plays we have just heard we should prefer a repetition
                        of the “Toreador" to any of the others. This impression is due to the foot
                        that most of the principals seemed more familiar with their lines and songs
                        than before. The part of "Giggs" gives great chances to the comedian, and
                        Mr. Cotter missed very few of them putting an amount of energy into his
                        acting that the house warmly appreciated. Miss Cor- lass made us wonder
                        whether she is more delightful and fascinating as a girl or a boy, while Mr.
                        Roberts—who surely should have played "Giggs"—made a lot of points in the
                        small part of "Gus Traill." Susan is not a character that suits Miss Morra,
                        though she made a very fair success of it, and Miss Marie Elba sang her
                        songs, especially "On, on he’s dashing," with great spirit and éclat. We
                        much admired the dancing of the little Gaiety trio and should have liked to
                        see them again, their one effort being very short and sweet.</p>

                        pieces given previously by the Bandmann opera company and it may fairly be
                        described as "operetta” in contradistinction to “musical comedy.” There is
                        nothing very remarkable about the plot, and the music contains too many
                        reminiscences, though the "Swing Song" is pretty enough in an unassuming
                        way, but there is at least a thread running through the piece and some of
                        the dialogue is really amusing. On Monday night the Bandmann opera company
                        were at the top of their form, and in spite of some "cutting" (justified
                        perhaps in one or two spoken passages and quite wanton in the case of some
                        of the songs sacrificed), the piece went well. The honors of the evening
                        were carried off by Miss Georgia Corlass, who made a very gay and attractive
                        Veronique, dancing and singing well and looking extremely attrac- tive, and
                        by Mr. Ralph Roberts, who had studied Willie Edouin to some purpose and gave
                        an admirable rendering of Mons. Coquenard. His duet with the bailiff (Mr.
                        Sinclair Cotter) and his flirtation with the Countess de Champ Azur (Miss
                        Wilmot Karkeet) delighted the audience. Mr. Cotter was also good—if a little
                        inclined to overact—while Mr. O’Connor showed almost too much restraint, but
                        was in capital voice. The parts of Agatha and Denise were also well filled
                        by Miss Ziegler and Miss Nora Morra. On the whole it was the best
                        performance that we have heard, though the orchestra and the performers were
                        at sixes and sevens on several occasions, owing, as a rule, to
                        misunderstandings with regard to the encores which were frequently demand-
                        ed. There was a large and appreciative au- dience and we hope that the
                        Bandmann opera company will be as much appreciated in the further East as
                        they have been in Cairo.</p>

                    <p>The choir of St Mark's Church, Alexandria, assisted by several members of the
                        choir of All Saints' Church, Ramleh, who afforded so much pleasure by their
                        able rendering of Gaul's “Holy City” in St Mark's last week, gave this
                        beautiful cantata again yesterday evening in All Saints' before an
                        appreciative congregation. The work was again given with much spirit and
                        effect, and soloists, chorus, organist and pianist deserve much credit for
                        their excellent interpretation of the work. In the unavoidable absence of
                        Mrs. Bayliss and Mr. Percy Smith, the soprano and bass solos in “List the
                        Cheru- bic Host" were most kindly and ably taken by Miss MunGavin and Mr.
                        Johnston. We hope this will not be the last time we may hear these choirs in
                        similar work.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Dear Mr. Editor,— I willingly confess
                        to be the writer of the letter signed "Harmony,” wherein it was stated that
                        I, and many others, thought Gaul's beautiful music deserved comment. It was
                        very disappointing to see my letter misinterpreted by "Accord,” of whose
                        letter I entirely disapprove. Only those who know certain details (which it
                        would not be wise to print) understand the real cause of complaint.
                        "Ex-Choirmaster" has written a letter which is a disguised apology for a
                        stupid blunder. If the person who was entrusted to write the report had done
                        so in time for you to publish it with the rest of the programme of events on
                        St Mark's Day, all this heated con- troversy, which has now assumed a most
                        unpleasant and un-Christianlike form, would have been avoided, and I think
                        it would be better that no more anonymous letters be published on the
                        subject, which I am sure must be very hurtful to Canon Ward, who is away at
                        Jerusalem and for whom we all have a most profound respect—Yours faithfully,

                        10.10 a.m. on the 1st inst. by the Dutch steamer “Sule”; the position given

                        conflict which took place. Whatever the actual cause of the con- flict, our

                    <head>LORD CROMER’S SANE IMPERIALISM.</head>
                    <p>No one whose business it is to study the varying phases of public opinion can
                        have failed to notice that at the present moment a certain pessimism
                        prevails among thoughtful men in regard to the future of the Empire. People
                        are inclined to talk as if there were no alternative to that egotistical
                        Imperialism which strives for monopoly abroad and protec- tion at home save
                        a Little Englandism which is fearful of all responsibility, which suspects
                        the right of the Anglo-Saxon race to develop and to role the “lesser breeds”
                        and which looks with anxiety and dread upon that vast heritage of Empire to
                        which we have succeeded. To men of sane and liberal ideals both alternatives
                        are odious. They do not want a grasping, arbitrary, material, “tied-house"
                        Empire on the one hand, and on the other they cannot endure the thought of
                        abandoning our heritage of rule, and of shrinking from the responsibilities
                        and duties which go with the “white man's burden." “Is there no third way?
                        Must the choice lie between these two alternatives?”—such are the questions
                        which they ask. In our opinion, there is another alternative. The true
                        solution of the Imperial problem is, we hold, to be found in that sane
                        Imperialism of which Lord Cromer is the latest, and one of the greatest
                        exponents. That sane, liberal, and dutiful Imperialism has made Egypt and
                        the Sudan what they are, just as in the past it gave us the India of
                        Dalhousie and the Lawrences the India we possess to-day—and laid the
                        foundations of those daughter-States on whose freedom and loyal independence
                        the safety and welfare of the Empire depend. The shrill, ir- responsible,
                        and reckless Imperialism which asserts that it is force or self-interest,
                        the sword or a protective tariff, which alone can maintain the Empire is
                        only a passing phase. The Empire owed nothing to it in the past, and can
                        gain nothing from it in the future. It is by the application of a wise and
                        free Imperialism that Empires such as ours are built up, and can alone be
                        developed and maintained. Such sane Imperialism tolerates no cant in regard
                        to the abstract right of persons who are obviously incapable of govern- ing
                        themselves to attempt the task, and makes no pretense that the Hindoo is
                        capable of rule because he can pass an examination in English literature. It
                        knows also that freedom and complete self-government are the only condi-
                        tions on which the white Anglo-Saxon com- munities oversea will remain
                        within the Empire, and that in their case the race-feeling and sentiment
                        which it is now the fashion to deride as worthless bonds are links of
                        adamant to unite the Empire, if only we keep them un- corroded from the mat
                        of a sordid materialism and selfish interests. In truth, the antiseptics of
                        Empire are two:- In the case of the subject and coloured populations,
                        strength and justice and the determination to govern not in the interests of
                        the governors but of the governed. In the case of those white communities
                        which are in reality Britains oversea, absolute free- dom and the resolve to
                        rest the Empire on sentiment and loyalty, and not on mere material
                        bonds.</p>
                    <p>But it may be asked,—How are we to learn and to preserve the spirit of this
                        sane Impe- rialism? The answer is,—By studying the work and carrying out the
                        principles of the great exponents of such Imperialism. As a concrete
                        example, we would point to Lord Cromer's Annual Report on Egypt and the
                        Sudan published this week. It is true that Lord Cromer has only been called
                        upon to deal in practice with one portion of the Imperial problem,—that
                        which concerns the subject races. None the less, those who have eyes to see
                        cannot fail to note that he has the root of the whole matter in him, and
                        that if he had been asked, either at the Colonial Office or in the
                        Anglo-Saxon communities oversea, to help to build np the self-governing
                        portions of the Empire, his influence would have been equally potent and
                        equally sound. It is impossible to read what he writes on subjects connected
                        with the Empire without realising that he under- stands the principles of
                        freedom as well as those of justice on which the Empire rests. Mr.
                        Chamberlain, in one of those moments of reck- lessness which have marked the
                        last phase of his Imperialism, has proclaimed the monstrous doctrine, "No
                        Preference, no Empire." It is to the men who, like Lord Cromer, have de-
                        termined, while shirking no responsibility of government, to let their role
                        and work be inspired by liberal ideals that we owe the Im- perial
                        fabric.</p>
                    <p>We wish we had space to draw attention in detail to the great number of wise
                        and inform- ing things said by Lord Cromer in his new Annual Report. What
                        makes that Report of special interest this year is the fact that it marks an
                        epoch. The Anglo-French Agree- ment has legalised our position in Egypt and
                        has given us a free hand. We have now the right to build as we will. That we
                        can now build for the prosperity of Egypt, and the honor of Britain and the
                        Empire, is due to the circumstance that Lord Cromer and the band of men who
                        have worked so loyally under him have laid the foundations of government
                        well and truly. But though we cannot follow Lord Cromer in detail through
                        his account of his stewardship in Egypt or in his various suggestions for
                        new developments, we may notice one or two of the principles of govern- ment
                        which are laid down in the Report. Lord Cromer, like the wise and practical
                        statesman he is, does not attempt to formulate principles of government in
                        the abstract. It is in the course of his handling of concrete facts that
                        these principles emerge. Perhaps the most striking example of what we mean
                        is to be found in the following passage:—</p>
                    <p>"In deciding what general policy is to be adopted in countries such as Egypt
                        and the Sudan, low taxation should be the keystone of the political arch. It
                        brings general tran- quillity in its train. It is an essential preli- minary
                        to steady and continuous moral and material improvement. It allows, either
                        at once or eventually, of the adoption, without serious danger to the State,
                        of a policy in other matters which is in general conformity with the liberal
                        views and traditions of the British Government and of the British nation.
                        Ex- penditure on objects, however desirable in themselves, should, I venture
                        to think, be rejected, or at all events postponed, rather than that the
                        principle of maintaining taxes at a low figure should be in any degree in-
                        fringed. That is the policy which, for more than twenty years, has been
                        adopted in Egypt and for some seven years in the Sudan." This sounds simple
                        and obvious enough, yet we believe it contains the grand secret of
                        government in the case of Orientals. To make men good subjects they must be
                        contented; but no Oriental will be contented merely because of roads,
                        railways, and other public improve- ments, even though these in reality
                        confer great benefits upon him. The one thing that he cares for, and in a
                        sense is grateful for, is low taxation. Hence Lord Cromer has always
                        insisted that as far as possible public expendi- ture should be kept low. He
                        has never yielded to the fatal temptation of arguing that even if taxation
                        is made high, the people cannot grumble when they receive all the benefits.
                        If you give an Oriental population reforms and improvements, you may give
                        them what is good for them, but you will not be giving them what they want.
                        If you give them low taxation, you are certain to be giving them what they
                        want, and what they understand. Another admirable statement which may prove
                        of use to administrators is to be found in the para- graphs that deal with
                        the European Civil ser- vants in Egypt, with the method of their selection,
                        and with the salaries of such officials. In the first place, Lord Cromer has
                        devised an excellent system for avoiding jobbery in appoint- ments on the
                        one hand, and the difficulties of pure competitive examination on the other.
                        In regard to the question of salaries Lord Cromer follows in the steps of
                        Lord Cornwallis. Lord Cornwallis, it may be remembered, once told the
                        Directors of the East India Company that they could get plenty of men to
                        take the post of Governor-General of India for nothing, but that it would be
                        extremely improvident of them to adopt such a course. It is in the spirit of
                        this luciferous saying that Lord Cromer handles the question of high
                        salaries. Before we leave the subject of Lord Cromer's Report we most find
                        space for the very satis- factory passage in which he awards praise and
                        credit to the young British officers who have helped that able
                        administrator, Sir Reginald Wingate, in the government of the Sudan:— “I am
                        not called upon to discuss, and still less to defend, the British military
                        system considered as a whole. But I wish to say something of the officers,
                        and more especially of the young officers, with whom I am brought in
                        contact, and of whose work, in connection with the civil affairs of the
                        Sudan, I have had some special opportunities of judging. Nothing has struck
                        me more than their, versa- tility. The readiness with which they adapt
                        themselves to novel ideas and circumstances is remarkable....It is generally
                        found that the officer throws himself with whole-hearted zeal into the work
                        which lies before him, whether it be military or civil. He identifies
                        himself with the people over whom he has to rule....As for capacity for
                        civil administra- tion, all I can say is that some of the most valuable
                        suggestions which have been received about such matters as land settlement,
                        agri- cultural loans, &amp;c., in the Sudan, have emanated from officers who
                        but a short time before were performing purely military duties. ......I
                        doubt if any country in the world can dispose of agents who are their
                        equals. They certainly cannot find their superiors. All they require, to
                        supplement any want of knowledge or experience on their part, is technical
                        advice on professional subjects, and a little friendly guidance on matters
                        of principle from some superior civilian authority. When once they are taken
                        away from the routine of the barrack- yard, given some interesting work to
                        perform, made responsible for the proper performance of that work, and left
                        a good deal to them- selves, they speedily develop that power of government
                        which, I trust I may be lowedal to say without incurring a charge of undue
                        national pride, is the prerogative of their Imperial race.”</p>
                    <p>That Lord Cromer’s experience is in no way exceptional we have not a doubt.
                        The ma- from which the British officer is ma- nufactured is the best
                        material in the nation, —the material which produces in the Law, in the
                        Church, and in commerce, keen, able men. If the British officer—though, in
                        our opinion, his defects are greatly exaggerated —sometimes fails to do
                        himself justice, the fault is not his, but that of the system under which he
                        works. Lord Cromer's splendid tri- bute to the young British officer will,
                        we trust, not only tend to encourage men who have to a very considerable
                        extent been un- fairly criticised, but also force the home authorities—on
                        whom, after all, the main responsibility rests—to consider whether there is
                        not something wrong in an organisation which is unable to get better results
                        out of such good material.</p>
                    <p>We can only end as we began, by strongly urging any who are inclined to
                        despair of the Empire, and to imagine that it cannot be maintained except
                        under the principle of monopoly, to turn to Lord Cromer's Report. They most
                        not, as we have said, expect to find strings of abstract disquisitions on
                        the art of government: but if they will study it carefully, and note the
                        spirit which inspires it, they cannot but rise from its perusal strength-
                        ened and vivified. They will realise that the carrying on of the work of
                        Empire is consistent with the maintenance of Liberal ideals—we use the word
                        in the non-party sense—and that instead of injuring those ideals at home,
                        the possession and development of an Empire governed on the principles of
                        sane Imperialism will lend them support. Imperial duties and
                        responsibilities, properly understood and carried out serve as antiseptics
                        in the body politic, and prevent the growth of that narrow and selfish
                        materialism which, as history shows, is apt to overcome the moral force of
                        small, popu- lous, and wealthy states. ("The Spectator”.)</p>

                <head>ARABIC TYPE. FIRST APPEARANCE IN ENGLAND.</head>
                <dateline>By Mr. Falconer Madan (B. N. C. Oxford).</dateline>
                <p>The use of Arabic and Syriac type in England can be carried a few years farther
                    back than Mr. Talbot Reed was able to do in his "History of Old English Letter
                    Foundries” (London, 1887), which is the recognised authority on such points. He
                    did not find any book in which Arabic occurred earlier than 1648, when Miles
                    Flesher printed at London a work ‘De Siglis Arabum.' And of Syriac he says that
                    it “did not make its appearance in England till the middle of the seventeenth
                    century"—in fact, not till the prospectus and specimen of Walton's Polyglot were
                    issued in 1652.</p>
                <p>In turning over a volume of the Thomason Civil War Tracts at the British Museum
                    lately, I was struck by a profusion of types of both languages in the margins of
                    ‘A Discovery of the Rebels' and ‘The Great Antichrist,' both by “J. V.,
                    Prisoner," and dated 1643 Thomason has noted that the author was Vicars, who was
                    not the well-known John Vicars, author of the ‘Parliamentary Chronicle,' but
                    John Viccars, an Oriental scholar, who was concerned with the preparation of the
                    Polyglot mentioned above. And on reference to Viccars’s one great work, the
                    “Decapla in Psalmos' (Londini, apud Robertum Young, Anno M. D. C. XXXIX), the
                    position became clear. ThE 'Decapla' is a commentary on the Psalms from sources
                    written in ten languages, and the title expressely states that it was "Novis
                    Typis Arab, and Syriacis Donates.” Here, then, is the first use of Arabic and
                    Syriac printing in England, in 1689. The whole fount is displayed on the last
                    leaf of the prefatory matter, and even Arabis and Syriac ligatures are to be
                    found in it.</p>
                <p>The dedication to Archbishop Laud states that “Decapla hæc, post annum integrum
                    sub prælo xXu3uvilisiav novis Typis Syriacis and Arabicis (sumptibus haud
                    exiguis) adornata in lucem emittuntor." This carries back the actual printing to
                    1638, and fits in with the letter from John Greaves of February 10th, 1637/8
                    (“Domestic State Papers,' vol. 381, No. 75), where a rather indefinite mention
                    is made of a purchase of Oriental puncheons (and ma- trixes?) by a Mr. Browne on
                    the Continent. This letter is mentioned by Mr. Talbot Reed. Even the "J. V.
                    Prisoner” is cleared up in the same dedication, where the author speaks of
                    himself as “post septennii vincula captivus.”</p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that in this very year 1639, when Dr. Thomas Greaves
                    printed his oration ‘De Linguæ Arabicæ utilitate’ and wished to print an Arabic
                    sentence, it is found in some copies written in in Arabic, and in some copies
                    printed in Hebrew type! The first Arabic printing at Oxford was in 1648, and the
                    first Syriac in 1661.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>THE ARAB CONQUEST OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Butler announces that he has come across a fresh piece of evidence for
                        the identi- fication of Al Mukaukas with Cyrus, Patriarch of Alexandria. In
                        the Syriac ‘Chronicon Ano- nymum,' edited with a Latin translation by Guidi,
                        occurs the following passage :- “Potiti sunt Arabes tota regione Syriæ et
                        Palæstine. Ægyptum quoque ingredi erat in animo: sed non valuerunt: custo-
                        diehantur enim fines magno exercitu et vi a patriarcha Alexandrino, locis
                        quoque quibus hostes in regionem ingredi aut egredi possont præclusis et
                        exstructis in ripa Nili per omnem regionem muris.” In other words, the
                        Moslem forces which over- ran Syria from 631 to 640 were deterred from an
                        earlier attempt on Egypt by a powerful Roman army placed on the borders, and
                        power- ful defences prepared, by the Patriarch of Alexandria. It is not open
                        to doubt that the Patriarch referred to is Cyrus, who was sent to Egypt as
                        Viceroy in 631, and the importance of the passage is that it furnishes
                        conclusive proof that Cyrus had the supreme military as well as civil
                        command, a point which has been called in question. Thus Prof. Lane-Poole,
                        in criticising the theory, remarks (Proc. Royal Irish Acad., vol. xxiv. sec.
                        C. 13, p. 254):- "Cyrus was Patriarch and civil governor, but not military
                        prefect; yet we find him (if be be El Mukawkis) commanding at the battle of
                        Heliopolis,” i.e.according to the Arab historians. Precisely, and given the
                        fact that Cyrus was responsible for the military defences of the country,
                        his command at the battle follows quite naturally.</p>
                    <p>Now as to the authority of the "Chronicon Anonymum.” Guidi is clear that the
                        document as it stands can be assigned with certainty to a date between 670
                        and 680, while the portions relating to the Persian kings have an air of
                        still greater antiquity. The writer was thus contemporary with, if not
                        earlier than, John of Nikiou, and may well have been actually con- temporary
                        with the conquest of Syria and Egypt. His authority, therefore, is of the
                        very highest order; it is independent of all Egyptian writers; yet, agreeing
                        as it does with John of Nikiou, it must be preferred, in any case of
                        collision, to that of the Arab historians, who were all much later.</p>

                    <p>Colonel the Hon. M. G. Talbot, R.E., who recently went on half-pay on giving
                        up the appointment of Director of Surveys under the Egyptian Administration,
                        has taken his retired full pay. He entered the service just 82 years ago and
                        saw a great deal of service in Afghanis- tan, 1877-78, the Mahsood-Wuzeree
                        Expedi- tion, 1881, and the smashing of Mahdiism in the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Cecil Pearce, 1st Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment, at Dublin,
                        has been promoted captain after a little over eight years' service. He
                        obtained his first commis- sion in February, 1898. This is the second
                        company promotion in the Royal Berks. this year.</p>
                    <p>At the Southern Police Court, Dublin, last Wednesday, Lieutenant Charles
                        Howard, Royal Berks. Regiment, was charged with being disorderly the
                        previous night in Dame Street, by having his coat off, shouting at the top
                        of his voice, challenging the crowd to fight him, and violently resisting
                        arrest. He was also charged with assaulting three constables. A medical
                        student, named M’Swiney, and Cap- tain T.R.B. Clifford, 3rd Connaught
                        Rangers, were also charged with attempting to rescue Lieutenant Howard. It
                        seemed that the de- fendants got involved in a row with the crowd coming out
                        of the Empire Music Hall, when the alleged assault on the constables took
                        place. For the defence it was stated that the defendants were assaulted by a
                        disorderly crowd, and that when Lieutenant Howard was being brought to the
                        police station he was struck twice by one of the constables on the eye. The
                        two officers were returned for trial to the City Sessions, in £10 bail, and
                        M’Swiney was fined in 20s., or 14 days, afterwards increased to 21s. to
                        admit of appeal, in addition to being returned for trial.</p>
                    <p>The following appears in the newspapers to- day :— Lieutenant Howard, of the
                        Berkshire Regi- ment, was charged at Dublin with participa- tion in a street
                        row, and was allowed out on bail to appear at the City Sessions. This was on
                        Wednesday. On Thursday a detective at Queenstown reported that he had
                        searched the luggage of a passenger giving the name of Courtney, who was
                        going on board the “Teu- tonic," bound for New York, and had strong
                        suspicions that he was Lieutenant Howard. Instructions were at once
                        telegraphed to Queenstown that Mr. “Courtney” should be detained, but
                        fifteen minutes before they were received the “Teutonic" had left, and Mr.
                        "Courtney” is now on his way to America.</p>
                    <p>The Sessions commence on May 6, and it is felt that the police cannot move in
                        the matter until then, as it is quite possible for Lieutenant Howard,
                        supposing it is he who left on the “Teutonic”, to voluntarily return by
                        then.</p>
                    <p>The friction between Lord Kitchener and the Military Member of the Council
                        was not al- together unexpected. Though the details of disagreement are not
                        yet specified, sufficient is told to give a broad, if not deep, insight into
                        the question. Lord Kitchener went to India as a reformer. Experience has
                        shown us that he belongs to the root-and-branch variety of that valuable
                        species. What is more, the country holds the firm opinion that this is just
                        the sort of reformer needed in India. Lord Kitchener, then, is interpreting
                        his duty as we would have him interpret it. In any circum- stances, perhaps,
                        he was bound to come into conflict with those who are euphemistically called
                        his colleagues. He could not by any possibility escape when his functions
                        are not clearly distinguished from those of the Military Member. It is a
                        consolation to be assured that there is no personal bitterness between the
                        two authorities who are at variance. It should be equally comforting to know
                        that Lord Kitchen- er has not disgressed from his intention. He means to
                        make the Indian Army an adequate machine for the tremendous purpose it has
                        to serve—the defence of the most vulnerable, or, at least, the most
                        threatened, part of the Empire. Nothing must be allowed to prevent him from
                        carrying that purpose into effect. If we cannot do without a really strong
                        Indian Army—and so much is absolutely certain—we certainly cannot allow the
                        man best capable of producing it to leave his plans half ac- complished.</p>
                    <p>The information furnished by Mr. Arnold- Forster in the House of Commons
                        regarding tho recruiting for the past six months, is any- thing but
                        encouraging to the chances of a long-service system of recruiting becoming
                        popular. It was hoped that it might have boon otherwise, since enlistments
                        for short ser- vice have been stopped for some six months now. The winter is
                        usually the best recruit- ing time of the year, and trade during the past
                        winter has been unusually slack. Yet for each month from October, 1904, to
                        March, 1905, there has been a falling off in the numbers taken, which
                        amounts to a loss of 3,140 as compared with the same period of 1903-4. All
                        this is very discouraging, but not in the least surprising to those who
                        doubted the success of Mr. Arnold-Forster’s methods. Meu do not en- list
                        nowadays from a sense of patriotism; the upper classes are sadly deficient
                        in patriotism, they are showing an increasing disinclina- tion to joining
                        even the commissioned ranks, because the prospects are so poor. It is hardly
                        to be expected that the poorer classes are going to enlist to gratify Mr.
                        Arnold- Forster and the Army Council. When the Army is made a career that
                        will compare favor- ably with civil occupations, recruits in plenty will to
                        forthcoming, and of the right sort. But there must be some assurance or
                        security that when a man leaves the Army he will be better off in the matter
                        of employment than if he had remained a civilian. In the present state of
                        feeling, I am afraid that any system of long- service recruiting is doomed
                        to failure.</p>
                    <p>After the termination of the combined man- œuvres of the Mediterranean and
                        Atlantic Fleets, the Second Cruiser Squadron under the command of H. S. H.
                        Prince Louis of Battenberg will proceed to Phalerum Bay to give leave for 24
                        hours. A cruise on the 11 Grecian coasts will follow, and about the 28th May
                        the squadron will leave for passage trial of 24 hours to Gibraltar. From the
                        latter place the squadron will leave tor Portland on the 3rd June.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH GOODS IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Messrs. W.P. Thompson and Co., chartered patent and trade mark agents, have
                        addressed the following letter to several home papers :—</p>
                    <p>We have received word from our agents in the Egyptian Sudan that that country
                        is being simply deluged with cheap Continental goods marked with English
                        trade marks; that the Custom House is desirous of stopping this trade, but
                        cannot do so, as the English manu- facturers have very few of them
                        registered their trade marks, but that they will at once stop such fradulent
                        importations of any regis- tered trade mark on the marks being put on the
                        register. The German manufacturers have been very much more wideawake than
                        the English in this respect. The Associated Brewers, of Pilsen, registered
                        their marks, and then got the Government to at once stop all beer imported
                        into Egypt and the Sudan with the word Pilsen or any of their marks on it,
                        unless shipped by them, and the Munich brewers have lately done the same as
                        regards Munchen and Munich. Some little time ago our agents discovered a
                        printing works in Egypt engaged almost exclusively in printing fraudulent
                        labels, which were used on goods sent not merely all over Egypt, but to
                        Singapore, Hong Kong, and elsewhere in the East. This place was broken up
                        through our agency by getting the rightful owners of these labels to
                        register, and then pouncing on it.</p>

                    <head>COAL IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In regard to the statements of experts as to the absence of coal in Egypt, it
                        is interesting to remember that less than forty years ago scientists
                        declared it impossible that diamonds could exist at Kimberley, unless they
                        were carried thither in the crops of ostriches from some unknown land.</p>
                    <p>Captain Lyons in a recent report states:— “No reliable evidence of the
                        occurrence of coal in workable quantities in Egypt has yet been forthcoming;
                        most of the strata are of marine origin, and those which are not, have so
                        far yielded no traces of carbonaceous deposits, beyond local layers of
                        lignite a few inches thick at the most. The chance that larger and thicker
                        deposits may yet exist at points where they are overlaid by other beds is a
                        very slight one, and up to the present no indications of such have been met
                        with, in spite of the borings 400 feet deep in the oases, and the wide area
                        which has been traversed without finding any outcrop of beds of this
                        nature.”</p>
                    <p>It will be remembered that last year, with the consent of the Emperor
                        Menelik, a geo- logical expedition, under Mr. Barron, had been sent into
                        Abyssinia with a view to discovering, first, whether the native reports of
                        the existence of coal wore correct; and, secondly, whether, there were any
                        coal-bearing strata running into the Sudan. Mr. Barron's report is to the
                        effect that coal exists in the neighbourhood of Chelga. The question of
                        whether there are any strata running into the Sudan remains un-
                        determined.</p>

                        gouverner ou au moudir, en indiquant le ma- gasin dans lequel ces objets
                        sont mis en vente.</p>
                    <p>Il est absolument défendu d’avoir dans la Province-Frontière, des dépôts
                        d’armes ou au- tres objets indiqués à l’article précédent.</p>
                    <p>L’autorité de police aura, dans cette pro- vince, le droit de fairs dee
                        visites domiciliaires, dans les formes prévues dans les Conventions
                        commerciales et le procès verbal y annexé pour les perquisitions faites dans
                        la ligne douanière, de saisir et de confisquer les armes et les autres
                        objets désignés ci-dessus.</p>
                    <p>Est permise l’importation des armes de chasse et de luxe, ainsi que des armes
                        de com- merce, des munitions et du matériel ci-dessous spécifiés:</p>

                    <p>Mais il est permis aux voyageurs d'importer des fusils rayés et leurs
                        cartouches pourvu qu'ils signent une déclaration par laquelle ils
                        reconnaissent que ces fusils sont pour leur pro- pre usage et que la vante

                        d'argent ou ci- selés artistiquement. Pour que les armes de luxe, à
                        l’exception des armes antiques, soient admises, le prix de vente ne devra

                        pistolets. Il est entendu que les armes dont l'introduc- tion est admise en
                        vertu des autres disposi- tions de ce tableau ne sauraient être considé-
                        rées comme armes de luxe et interdites sous prtexte que leur valeur est
                        inférieure aux prix fixés.</p>
                    <p>Les personnes qui important des armes de luxe seront admises à importer en
                        même temps cent cartouches chargées à petit plomb, pour cheque fusil,

                    <p>Tout voyageur muni de passeport ou teskéré en règle ne pourra importer qu’un
                        seul pistolet revolver ou une paire de pistolets de n’importe quelle sorte
                        plus cent cartouches chàrgées au maximum.</p>
                    <p>Toutes les armes dont l'importation est admise seront, après vérification de
                        la Douane, sans délai ni frais pour le propriétaire, à son choix, et par les
                        soins de cette administration, munies d'une ficelle plombée ou
                        poinçounnées.</p>
                    <p>L’introduction de tout matériel d'arme, de toutes munitions non mentionnés
                        dans le pré- sent tableau, de toute sorte de poudre, ainsi que de toutes les
                        compositions qui ont la même destination ou qui, inventées plus tard,
                        pourraient produire les mêmes effets que la poudre, telles que la dynamite,
                        la poudre coton dite fulmi-coton et coton azotique, la nitro- glycérine, les
                        picrates et fulminates, les mèches à mines et autres matières fulminantes de
                        ce genre, du salpêtre raffiné et non raffiné et du chlorate de potasse, est
                        interdite.</p>
                    <p>Toutefois, la défense d'importer des matières explosives n'emporte pas
                        prohibition d'impor- tation et de vente des produits qui, en vertu de leur
                        composition, sont explosifs dans cer- taines conditions ou qui peuvent
                        servir à la fabrication de matières explosives, comme, par exemple, le

                    <head>THE PORT SAID SALT ASSOCIATION LIMITED.</head>
                    <p>La sixième Assemblée Générale Ordinaire des actionnaires de "The Port Said
                        Salt Asso- ciation" a eu lieu à Alexandrie le 29 avril. Voici le rapport du
                        conseil d’Administration qui a été lu et approuvé à la dite assemblée:—</p>
                    <p>L’Assemblée générale extraordinaire du 30 Avril de l’année dernière décidait
                        l’augmenta- tion du capital à £ 100.000, par l’émission de 32.500 Actions de
                        £ 1, et le 4 mai; lo Conseil d’Administration adressait aux Actionnaires une
                        lettre exposant la situation de la Société, ses besoins, et demandait aux
                        Actionnaires do souscrire une partie du nouveau capital, l’autre partie
                        étant converte par vos Administrateurs mêmes.</p>
                    <p>Le peu d’empressement des Actionnaires a répondre à l’appel du Conseil a eu
                        pour consé- quence la decision de réduire le capital, afin de balancer les
                        pertes et de permettre aux nou- veaux Actionnaires d’entrer dans une affaire
                        dégagée de toutes les anciennes passivités, et présentant une situation
                        nette de la Société.</p>
                    <p>Les Assemblies générales extraordinaires tenues k Londres les 4 et 19 octobre
                        dernier, ont ddcidd la reduction du capital de £ 67.600 à £ 33.750, divisé
                        en 67.500 Actions de £0.10.0 chacune.</p>
                    <p>La Haute-Cour de Justice de Londres a ra- tifé le 18 mai dernier, les
                        décisions des Ac- tionnaires.</p>
                    <p>L'Assembles générale extraordinaire du 31 Mars qui a eu lieu à Londres a
                        décidé de por- ter le capital à £ 100.000, divisé en 200,000 Actions de £
                        0.10.0 et votre Conseil, en vertu des pouvoirs statutaires, a décidé de
                        faire une émission de 92.500 Actions, afin de porter, pour le moment, le
                        capital effectif de la Société à £ 80.000, avec privilege de souscription en
                        faveur des Actionnaires actuels au prorata des Actions qu’ils possèdent:</p>
                    <p>L'augmeniation du capital servira à pourvoir la Société d'un fonds de
                        roulement nécessaire pour ses affaires et éviter de recourir au crédit, et à
                        perfoctionner et computer les installations aux salines, de de façon à
                        pouvoir réaliser de notables économies dans les manutentions et les
                        embarquements de sel.</p>
                    <p>BILAN.</p>
                    <p>Le Bilan annexé au présent Rapport repré- sente la situation de la Société
                        après la réduc- tion du capital. Cette réduction a servi à amor- tir les
                        dépréciations anciennes, les pertes des exercices précédents et la valeur de
                        88,878 tonnes de sel des premières récoltes dont la couleur était
                        défectueuse.</p>
                    <p>Cost done un Bilan qui représente très net- tement la situation nouvelle de
                        la Société. En fait, los nouvaux Actionnaires entrent dans une affaire
                        régénérée, avec l'avantage de l’expérience acquise, de la connaissance des
                        besoins et d'une clientèle déjà formée.</p>
                    <p>VENTES DE SEL.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons appliqué toute notre énergie à la recherche de marchés pour le
                        placement de notre sel ordinaire, et nos efforts ont été cou- ronnés de
                        succès, car, depuis la fin de l’année 1904 jusqu’à ce jour, nous avons
                        effectué pour environ 50.000 tonnes de ventes de sel ordi- naire, en partie
                        livré et à livrer. Quant au sel moulu, nos moyens ne nous ont permis qu’une
                        petite installation avec laquelle nous avons pu faire une première
                        expédition qui sera suivie d’autres. Nous avons en perspective d'autres
                        opérations et nous espérons qu’une fois les sa- lines dotées de toutes les
                        installations néces- saires, nous serons en mesure de concourir sur
                        plusieurs marchés aves chance de succès.</p>
                    <p>Notre tâche sera facilitée par la bienveillance du Gouvernement Egyptien qui
                        a bien voulu réduire la redevance que nous avions à payer, suivant notre
                        acte de concession, sur le sel exporté.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons exposé nos sels à l’Exposition de Saint-Louis et avons obtenu le
                        Grand Prix.</p>
                    <p>En résumé, la situation actuelle de notre Société s’est grandement améliorée,
                        ses per- spectives d'avenir sont bonnes, et nous espé rons que les
                        sacrifices faits par les Actionnaires seront largement compensés dans
                        l'avenir.</p>

                    <head>LES TERRAINS DU MARIOUT LA LEGISLATION MIXTE</head>
                    <p>Jusqu’ici les tribunaux de Justice sommaire ont généralement admis qu’en
                        matière posses- soire il était superflu d’examiner les titres ou l’origine
                        de la possession et qu’il suffisait du témoignage de quelques brigands
                        nomades pour instituer un individu quelconque proprié- taire de vastes
                        étendues de terrains. L'occupa- tion des dits terrains depuis une année une
                        fois prouvée par témoins, le légitime proprié- taire se trouvait évincé par
                        jugement exécu- taire nonobstant appel et, s’il avait eu l’audsce de faire
                        expulser l’intrus, celui-ci se trouvait bientôt réintégré par les moyens
                        exposés ci- dessus.</p>
                    <p>Ce procédé judiciaire peut convenir aux ré- gions habitées où le lot de
                        chacun est nette- ment défini, mais il devient déplorable dans les tastes
                        étendues peu fréquentées du Mariout où il ouvre la porte à toutes les
                        convoitises et permet a l’usurpateur de spolier le véritable propriétaire à
                        l’aide des lois mêmes qui de- vraient protéger ce dernier.</p>
                    <p>Aussi sommes-nous heureux de voir la Cour rompre avec la routine et donnant
                        aux lois une interprétation plus large à la fois et plus rationnelle,
                        remonter jusqu’à la source de la possession qui est le titre légal</p>
                    <p>Agopian et Cts, bien qu'en possession de justes titres de propriété an
                        Mariout depuis nombre d'années, s’étaient vus dernièrement spoliés de vive
                        force avec le concours de la police locale et des agents du Gouvernement.
                        Dans l’action qu’ils intentèrent alors devant le tribunal sommaire, ils
                        furent déboutés; mais, ayant fait appel, ils viennent d’obtenir satis-
                        faction.</p>
                    <p>Voici lea principaux attendus de l‘arrêt:</p>
                    <p>Attendu que c’est à tort que le premier juge a attribué à l’action des
                        demandeurs un "ca- ractère pétitoire,” et ce en posant en principe “que la
                        possession ne pourrait se prouver par des titres."</p>
                    <p>Qu'en effet tons les moyens de preuves sont admis en la matière et, en tout
                        premier lieu les titres lesquels offrent d’ailleurs fré- quemment des
                        éléments d’appréciation plus sérieux que les enquêtes;</p>
                    <p>Qu’au surplus le prétendu caractère pétitoire de la présente demande aurait
                        dû amener le premier juge à décliner purement et simple- ment sa compétence,
                        et ce, même d'office. Que ce sont, en effet, exclusivement les “conclusions
                        de la demande" qui sont à considérer pour déterminer la nature d'une action,
                        et ce "pré- liminairement” et par suite indépendamment de tout examen de
                        fond (C. de P. 148); or, en l’espèce les demandeurs se sont bornés à récla-
                        mer leur "réintégration dans la possession d’immeubles" dont ils prétendent
                        avoir été violemment dépossédés; qu’il est, en effet, de doctrine et de
                        jurisprudence que c’est “l’origine de la possession" qui doit être envisagée
                        pour apprécier le point de savoir si elle a le carac- tère paisible requis
                        par la loi, et que les trou- bles apportés à une possession acquise sans
                        violence ne constituent pas un vice possessoire rendant l’action
                        irrecevable, dès que ce trouble n’est pas allé jusqu’à opérer une
                        dépossession annale; qu'admettre le contraire aboutirait à cette conséquence
                        absurde qu’un trouble pos- sessoire pourrait devenir le titre d’une pos-
                        session;</p>
                    <p>Invoquer comme un titre de possession un acte de rébellion contre l’autorité
                        judiciaire est une énormité;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que le seul fait de contester dans un procès possessoire soit la
                        possession juridi- que du demandeur (jus possessionis), soit son droit à la

                    <p>Work in the oasis of Khargeh is progres- sing satisfactorily. The flow from
                        No. 1 borehole has, if anything, increased, and the land in its vicinity is
                        being rapidly prepared for cultivation. There is a good depth of soil which
                        dries tight and is, so far as can be an judged, of excellent quality.</p>
                    <p>The well inside the Deir has been cleaned and an 8-inch pipe put in to a
                        depth of eighty feet, with the result of considerably increasing the flow
                        and raising the head, which, with the well already in operation immediately
                        outside tho Deir, should allow of the cultivation of a considerable area.
                        Experimental garden cultivation is now going on with a view of determining
                        the vegetables suited to the soil and climate. </p>
                    <p>Several new alum beds have been located. Boring operations will now be
                        temporarily suspended, as it is desirable to modify some portions of the
                        apparatus so as to deal more economically with the considerable bodies of
                        water which have been shown to exist at various depths.</p>
                    <p>The work of exploration and general de- velopment will however continue
                        throughout the summer, while preparations for the con- struction of the
                        railway are being actively pushed forward. The company’s engineers have also
                        nearly completed a very detailed and accurate survey of the oasis.</p>

                        satisfactory. The 160-ft. level west of East shaft has been driven 472 ft.,
                        and the reef in the end is 4 ft wide, composed of solid quartz, panning 1}
                        ox. to the ton. West shaft has reached a depth of 188 ft, the reef in the
                        bottom being 2 ft wide and worth 8 dwt Good values are also being met with
                        in drivages from the Nos. 2 and 3 air shafts east A most interesting and
                        important discovery has recently been made to the south of Central shaft A
                        cross-cut put out from the 120-ft level' east intersected some ancient
                        workings filled with débris. On driving east and west the old workings were
                        soon passed, through, and the report now before us states that in one end
                        the reef is 1 ft 8 in. wide, worth 2 1/2 oz., and in other 3 ft wide,
                        assaying 2 oz. This is highly encouraging, and goes to confirm the belief
                        that this is going to be a rich property. Good progress is being made with
                        tho construction of the railway, which is expected to be completed in about
                        two months from now.</p>

                    <p>It was with interest I read the communica- tion from a correspondent as to
                        the above which appeared in the "Engineering Supplement to the "Times”of
                        last week. Having been a member of "The International Engineering Congress,
                        Glasgow, 1901” when Mr. (now Sir W.) Will- cocks read a paper on "Irrigation
                        in the Nile Valley and Its Future," perhaps you will allow me to observe
                        that the grievance he scorned to have was that, although he had designed a
                        reservoir to hold 85 milliards of cubic feet of water, the reservoir
                        actually then being made would only hold 85 milliards of cubic feet of
                        water. Further, Mr. Willcocks gave an opinion that if all Egypt was to be
                        put under perennial irrigation 200 milliards of cubic feet of water would
                        require to be impounded; so that the reservoir at Assouan contains but one
                        sixth of the total amount of water that will require to be impounded for
                        summer irrigation in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>A correspondent writes regarding a statement concerning the alleged
                        superiority of French over English pumps which appeared in a com- munication
                        from its Alexandria correspondent published in the ‘Times’:- "I note a
                        passage in the communication from your correspondent in Alexandria in which
                        he says, 'The superiority of French steam pumps is an oft recurring instance
                        in Egypt. When British manufacturers and inventors can produce an improved
                        ap- pliance, then the French pump will be relegated to a second place, but
                        not before. The supremo test is one of merit.' As one who is almost as much
                        at home in Egypt as in this country, and perfectly acquainted with the
                        industrial conditions of the country, and possessing some knowledge also of
                        the relative merits of French and British pumping machinery, I feel it due
                        to British makers of this class of plant to enter an earnest protest against
                        the statement made by your correspondent. I assert it is not the fact that
                        French steam pumps are superior to English in Egypt. I may point out that a
                        number of the pumps at Mex were made by Farcoll of Paris, and a number by
                        Gwynnes, of London. I believe the latter show an efficiency of at least 20
                        per cent, more than those made by the French manufacturers, and that this
                        instance might be repeated whenever French and English pumps are in
                        operation together.”</p>

                    <p>“To a society woman whose nervous force is often taxed to the utmost from
                        lack of rest and irregular meals, I know of nothing which is of so much
                        benefit as Peruna. I took it a few months ago when I felt my strength giving
                        way, and it soon made itself manifest in giving me new strength and health.

                    <p>ASSIOUT COLLEGE.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                    <p>Sir,— Many who read the article attributed to your correspondent of Assiout
                        about the American Mission College's entertainment, were extremely surprised
                        and have urged me to explain the truth. It seems that the critical arguments
                        against the College are founded on the entire ignorance of the writer of
                        both the fiscal and educational situation of the college. I do not intend to
                        defend the custom of prefer- ring Oriental to Occidental styles of dress
                        from the point of view of health, but from another point of view, which may
                        be unobser- ved by your correspondent. The college does not set a great
                        importance upon the value of clothes, but on cleanliness. Therefore it does
                        not urge the students to put on European garb, as most of them are poor. But
                        the college teaches them to respect their useful customs, and if any does so
                        of his own accord, no objection is raised. The suggestion of the
                        correspondent will hang like a millstone round the pupils' necks, especially
                        those of the lower and middle classes, and thus things will be made worse.
                        The income of the college a few years ago could hardly cover the expenses
                        for food. How is it now-a-days when everything is enhancing in value, and
                        the college cannot afford food or clothes?</p>
                    <p>As to the other criticism, I do not like to declare that the correspondent
                        does not know a wolt from a lamb, but I want to point out that the
                        experience of the competent teachers of the Government and native schools,
                        who are well acquainted with the best writers, will lead to familiarity with
                        the idiomatic expres- sion of a foreign language. Moreover, while the
                        students perform such exercises, they do not neglect their daily duties, and
                        their spare time is devoted to weekly literary societies, the object of
                        which is to enable the pupils to practise composition and oratory in both
                        the English and Arabic languages, under the direction of competent teachers,
                        who select the most moral and interesting subjects. In conclu- sion the
                        country is greatly indebted to the college whose aim is to bring up self
                        support- ing young men.—I remain, etc., </p>
                    <p>A. Kastour. </p>
